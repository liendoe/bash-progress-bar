# bash-progress-bar
Progress Bar for procedures in BASH shellscript (ALFA)

A litle progress bar for those that like to show the status of there process. 

The project is focused on taking numeric outputs from other processes and transforming it into a percentage of progress shown by the progress bar.

Actual status: 
  - Alfa
  - Only works with static values of total=100.
  - Does not read inputs from "x" source yet...
  
TODO:
  - Set the entry values to dynamic values according to the number of records or data to be processed.
  - Create a output reader function to get the numeric outputs from other projects.
